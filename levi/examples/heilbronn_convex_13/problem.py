# Heilbronn Convex Problem (n={NUM_POINTS})

## Problem
Place exactly {NUM_POINTS} points in the plane R^2 so that the smallest
triangle area formed by any 3 of them, **after normalising by the convex-
hull area of all {NUM_POINTS} points**, is as large as possible.

Unlike the fixed-region Heilbronn variant, you choose BOTH the points and
the enclosing convex shape — the convex hull of your output IS the
enclosing region.

Return a NumPy-compatible array ``points`` with shape ({NUM_POINTS}, 2),
where row i is the (x, y) coordinate of the i-th point.

## Feasibility Constraints
- ``points`` must have shape ({NUM_POINTS}, 2) and contain only finite
  numeric values.
- The {NUM_POINTS} points must be in **general position**: their convex
  hull must have strictly positive area. Collinear or fully-duplicated
  point sets are rejected with an error and score 0.
- There are **no coordinate-range constraints**: the score is invariant
  under translation, rotation, reflection, and uniform scaling, so any
  coordinate range you find convenient is fine.

## Objective
Let ``H = ConvexHull(points)`` and let ``min_area`` be the minimum area
over all C({NUM_POINTS}, 3) =
{len(list(itertools.combinations(range(NUM_POINTS), 3)))} triangles
formed by triples of your {NUM_POINTS} points. Maximize

    score = min_area / area(H)

The AlphaEvolve / best-known reference is
``score = {BENCHMARK:.16f}``; a ``combined_score`` of 1.0 matches that
value. Higher scores beat the reference.

## Runtime Constraint
Your function must complete within **{TIMEOUT_SECONDS} seconds**.
