# PRISM Problem

## Problem Setting
Optimize the placement of machine learning models across GPUs to minimize the maximum KV Cache Pressure (KVPR). Given a set of models with varying sizes, request rates, and SLO requirements, determine the optimal assignment of models to GPUs while respecting memory constraints.

KVPR (KV Cache Pressure) measures how crowded a GPU is:
```
KVPR = sum(model.req_rate / model.slo for model in gpu_models) / (GPU_MEM_SIZE - sum(model.model_size for model in gpu_models))
```

Lower maximum KVPR across all GPUs is better.

## Target
- **Primary**: Minimize maximum KVPR across all GPUs (lower is better)
- **Hard Constraint**: Models must fit within GPU memory (80GB per GPU)
- **Secondary**: Maximize successful placement rate across test cases

## Scoring (0-100)
```
baseline_kvpr = Average max-KVPR using round-robin placement
optimal_kvpr = Theoretical minimum KVPR with perfect load balance
solution_kvpr = Your solution's average max-KVPR across all test cases

For each test case:
    raw_ratio = (baseline_kvpr - solution_kvpr) / (baseline_kvpr - optimal_kvpr)
    clamped_ratio = clamp(raw_ratio, 0, 1)
    test_score = 100 * sqrt(clamped_ratio)

final_score = Average of individual test scores
```

The sqrt scaling provides diminishing returns as solutions approach optimal, giving more credit for initial improvements over the baseline.

## Implementation Notes
- GPU memory: 80 GB per GPU
- Model sizes: 10-30 GB
- Request rates: 1-10 requests/second
- SLO targets: 5-10 (latency units)
- Number of models per test: 2x gpu_num
- Number of GPUs per test: 5-10
- Each test case has a 10-second timeout
- 50 test cases are evaluated
- Test cases use a fixed random seed (42) for reproducibility

# PRISM (GPU Model Placement) Optimization

## Problem
Optimize the placement of machine learning models across GPUs to minimize the maximum
KV Cache Pressure (KVPR). Given models with varying sizes, request rates, and SLO
requirements, determine optimal assignment while respecting memory constraints.

KVPR measures how crowded a GPU is:
```
KVPR = sum(model.req_rate / model.slo for model in gpu_models) / (GPU_MEM_SIZE - sum(model.model_size for model in gpu_models))
```

Lower maximum KVPR across all GPUs is better.

## Key Concepts
- Models must fit within GPU memory (80GB per GPU)
- Each model assigned to exactly one GPU
- Model sizes: 10-30 GB, request rates: 1-10 req/s, SLO targets: 5-10
- Number of models per test: 2x gpu_num, GPUs per test: 5-10
- Scoring uses sqrt scaling: score = 100 * sqrt((baseline - solution) / (baseline - optimal))

## Function Signature
```python
def compute_model_placement(gpu_num: int, models: list[Model]) -> dict[int, list[Model]]:
    '''

## Your Task: ALGORITHMIC DIVERSITY

Design a solution using a **FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ALGORITHM** than the existing seeds.

**DO NOT:**
- Make minor variations or parameter tweaks
- Use the same core algorithm with different constants

**DO:**
- Analyze what paradigm each existing seed uses
- Design from first principles using a different strategy
- Consider what information the existing seeds are NOT using

    - validation failures (wrong shape / missing / duplicate / foreign model /
      memory violation) reject the whole candidate (fail-fast, anti-reward-hack)

    NOTE: this is NOT normalized to [0, 100]; it returns the raw reciprocal of
    the mean per-test max-KVPR plus the success rate, exactly like skydiscover.

    Reproducibility / anti-fluke fixes (see git history):

    1. RNG is seeded once per candidate.  Some candidates use the ``random``
       module without seeding it, so their placement — and therefore their
       score — was non-deterministic.  BLADE evaluates each candidate exactly
       once and freezes that score in the archive, so an unseeded candidate
       could be admitted on a lucky draw and never reproduce.  Seeding here
       makes every candidate's score deterministic for a fixed test set.

    2. ``avg_kvpr`` is averaged over ALL ``total_tests`` cases, with a test
       that raises (or violates a constraint) contributing a large penalty
       KVPR rather than being silently dropped.  The previous code divided the
       summed KVPR by the number of *passing* tests only: a candidate that
       crashed on 49/50 cases but happened to leave a single very-low-KVPR
       placement on the survivor scored 1/0.0233 + 0.02 ≈ 42.9 — far past the
       legitimate record of ~26.26 — purely because the lone survivor was
       averaged against itself.  Penalising failed tests in the mean closes
       this hole; a candidate that crashes on most cases can no longer be
       inflated by one lucky survivor.
