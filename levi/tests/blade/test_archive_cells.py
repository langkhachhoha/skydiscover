"""Cell-count invariant tests for ClusterArchive.

These tests pin the fix that the previous BLADE runs collapsed to
``num_occupied_cells = 16`` for the entire evolution despite
``n_cells = 32`` being requested. The root cause was twofold:

1. ``KMeans`` was being asked for ``k = min(n_cells, n)`` clusters,
   so once ``n`` dropped (coalescing after a recluster) ``k`` stayed
   low forever.
2. The coalesce step kept only the top-score program per cell, so the
   population shrank to ``num_occupied_cells`` and the next recluster
   could not see enough points to grow.

The new contract: ``n_cells`` is held FIXED across the run; KMeans is
not fit until at least ``n_cells`` programs have been admitted; and
once fit, ``len(centroids) == n_cells`` always.
