"""Tests for the BLADE meta-advisor ("Advisor") prompt + error signatures.

The Advisor assigns credit by **behavioural niche (archive cell)**, never by
which prompt-template produced a program. On each trigger it receives:

* LEADING niches — the top-score cell incumbents (description + score).
* IMPROVING niches — cells whose frontier advanced in the current window.
* SATURATED niches — cells that keep attracting attempts but whose frontier
  has not moved, with their recent-attempt count.
* UNDER-EXPLORED niches — occupied cells with few recent attempts.
* An *accumulated* failure-knowledge base: every error seen so far, grouped
  by a domain-agnostic :func:`error_signature` and counted by recurrence.

These tests pin (a) that all signal streams flow through the prompt verbatim,
(b) that the four-section ``WORKING / SATURATED / TRY NEXT / AVOID`` contract
is announced in order, (c) that ``error_signature`` collapses the same failure
with different numbers into one key, (d) that ``errors_only`` ablation parity
is achievable by passing empty success-side sequences, and (e) that long
descriptions / error examples are truncated.
