"""Tests for the BLADE analyzer cache (Đề xuất 1, accumulating policy).

Each ``_refresh_analyses`` call:

1. Evicts cache entries whose ``id()`` no longer maps to a program
   currently in the archive (the program got kicked out by a better
   cell incumbent, or dropped during a re-cluster).
2. Walks the archive in score-descending order and picks the first
   ``analyzer_top_k`` programs that do NOT yet have a cache entry.
   Programs that are already cached are skipped — their analysis is
   not re-generated.

Behavioural consequence with a frozen top-K: refresh #1 covers ranks
1-3, refresh #2 covers ranks 4-6, refresh #N covers ranks 3(N-1)+1…3N,
until the archive is fully cached, after which refreshes are no-ops
unless cell churn introduces a fresh program.

We do not call any LLMs here — we monkey-patch ``_analyze_parent`` so
each "analysis" is just a marker string, then assert which programs
got analysed across successive refreshes.
