"""BLADE Lite orchestrator.

Async event loop that drives a mutation-model pool plus periodic
frontier paradigm shifts. The control flow is intentionally simple —
the only sophistication lives inside :class:`ClusterArchive` (adaptive
hybrid-behavior MAP-Elites) and :class:`RankSampler` (Zipfian rank).

Phases:

1. **Bootstrap phase 1** — frontier model writes ``n_diverse_seeds``
   paradigm seeds sequentially, each one shown the seeds already
   accepted so the model is pushed toward fresh paradigms.

2. **Bootstrap phase 2** — mutation model fans out
   ``n_variants_per_seed`` variants per seed in parallel.

3. **Main loop** — up to ``n_workers`` mutate/crossover workers running
   concurrently. Every ``pe_cron_interval`` evaluations a
   background task fires a paradigm shift: frontier writes one seed
   informed by the current cell representatives (one program per cell,
   ranked by score, capped at ``paradigm_n_anchors``), then the
   mutation model fans out ``n_paradigm_variants`` variants.

The orchestrator deliberately has **no** Hall-of-Fame, **no** grace
period, **no** selector boost, **no** quota cap. A program enters the
archive only if it beats the incumbent of its cell, and once in, it is
treated like any other program. The archive's cells are re-clustered
periodically so the niche structure follows the search rather than
being imposed up-front.
