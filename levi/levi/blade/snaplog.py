"""``snap.json`` — the live search trace of a SpecEvo/BLADE run.

``snapshot.json`` is a *terminal* dump: it says what the archive looked
like when the run stopped. It cannot answer "how did the search get
there" — which Navigator mode fired when, whether the expensive frontier
call actually moved the needle, and which Speculator operator produced
each record. ``snap.json`` is the complementary *timeline*: an
append-only event log written incrementally (and flushed after every
event, so a killed or timed-out run still has a complete trace up to the
moment it died).

Two event kinds are recorded, both carrying the full code and
description of the program involved:

``navigator``
    One frontier (Navigator / paradigm-shift) call. Records which of the
    three modes was routed to — ``synthesis`` / ``surgical`` / ``shift``
    — the stagnation that routed it, the anchors it was shown, what came
    back, whether it was admitted, and how its cheap variant fanout did.

``new_best``
    Every time the run's best score improves. Records which producer
    made it (``speculator`` / ``navigator`` / ``navigator_variant`` /
    ``init``), the exact operator label (e.g. ``mutate_targeted``,
    ``crossover_structural``), the improvement over the previous best,
    and how many evaluations the search had spent since the last record.

A rolling ``summary`` block sits above the events so the headline
question — how much of the progress each component is responsible for —
is answerable without parsing the timeline.

The logger is deliberately defensive: every public method swallows its
own exceptions. Instrumentation must never take down a paid run.
