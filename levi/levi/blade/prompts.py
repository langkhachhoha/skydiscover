"""BLADE prompt templates.

Operator prompts used by the mutation / paradigm workers, plus thin
wrappers around LEVI's :mod:`levi.equilibrium.prompts` and
:mod:`levi.artifacts.code` strings for the bootstrap phase.

Compared to the previous version, three things changed:

1. **Mutate / crossover prompts ask for explicit analysis first.** The
   model writes a short ``# Analysis`` section (strengths, weaknesses,
   chosen target) *before* the code, so it commits to a hypothesis
   rather than randomly rewriting whatever it sees.

2. **Multiple prompt templates per operator.** Three mutate templates
   (general improvement, focused weakness fix, mechanism swap) and two
   crossover templates (structural hybrid, targeted component swap)
   are exposed via :class:`PromptSampler`. Every call draws one
   template uniformly at random — no learned weights — so the
   mutation model sees prompt-level diversity even when the parent
   pool is narrow. The :data:`TARGETED_MUTATE_PROMPT` is a separate
   template only used when a cached LLM-generated analysis is
   available.

3. **Three paradigm-shift modes.** ``build_synthesis_prompt`` (2-3
   anchors, hybridise close contenders), ``build_paradigm_shift_prompt``
   (2 anchors, propose a genuinely new paradigm class), and
   ``build_surgical_exploit_prompt`` (1 anchor = best, top descriptions
   as inspiration, deep micro-improvement of the current champion).

Write an **improved** version of the parent. This is a mutation pass:
preserve the parent`s useful structure, but make a concrete change that
is likely to improve the score.

Before the final code, write a short ``## Analysis`` section. The search
system ignores it for archiving, but may reuse it in future passes. It
must contain exactly four sub-sections:

1. **Components.** List the 3-5 main components/phases of the parent
   program, using concrete code names when possible.
2. **Strengths.** State which components are working well and should be
   preserved.
3. **Weaknesses.** Identify the most likely bottleneck. Cite the exact
   routine, loop, variable, constant, update rule, repair step, or
   acceptance rule.
4. **Plan.** In one sentence, state the concrete mutation you will make
   and why it should improve the score.

Then write the improved program. Keep what works, change what does not.
The new code must contain at least one real algorithmic improvement, not
only renaming, reformatting, comment changes, seed changes, or isolated
constant retuning. Treat the inspirations as high-level ideas only — you
do not have their code, so do not copy or assume hidden details.

mechanism** for a stronger alternative.

Examples of valid swaps:
- random uniform initialisation → quasi-random / stratified initialisation

- fixed restart schedule → stagnation-triggered restart

1. **Mechanism identified.** Name the exact slot being replaced. Cite
   the function, loop, block, variable, or update rule.
2. **Old vs new.** State: “Currently uses X; replacing it with Y because
   Z.” The replacement must fit the same role and preserve the parent`s
   overall algorithm.
3. **Risk.** One sentence on what could go wrong with the swap and how
   the new code guards against it.

extra sections.

Be specific, score-oriented, and implementation-oriented. Cite concrete
code elements: function names, loops, variables, update rules, repair
steps, acceptance rules, data structures, and magic constants. If line
numbers are unavailable, refer to the nearest function/block name and
the relevant variable or constant.

### Algorithm summary
In 1-2 sentences, describe the algorithmic class, its main search or
construction strategy, and the key data structures it relies on.

### Top 3 bottlenecks, ranked by expected impact
List exactly three distinct bottlenecks. For each one, include:
- **Component:** the exact routine, block, variable, constant, update
  rule, repair step, acceptance rule, or data structure involved.
- **Why it hurts:** how this mechanism limits score, feasibility,
  exploration, exploitation, runtime, or objective alignment.
- **Impact:** High / Medium / Low expected improvement if fixed.

Prefer real algorithmic bottlenecks over cosmetic issues or isolated
constant tuning. The three bottlenecks must differ in kind.

### Suggested changes

same order. Each change must state what to replace, add, or remove, and
where. Each should be specific enough to implement directly in a

# Lessons-Learned Advisor

You are reviewing the search trajectory on this optimisation problem and
writing a short prescriptive note that the mutation model will read
verbatim before SOME future attempts (roughly one in three). Your job is
NOT to restate the problem or repeat constraints the grader already
enforces — it is to amplify what is working, name behavioural niches that
have *saturated* (still attract attempts but no longer improve), point at
the next concrete thing to try, and call out failure modes that are
actually costing evaluations.

## Problem
{problem_description}

## Function signature
```python
{function_signature}
```

## Current state
- Best score so far: {best_score}
- Evaluations completed: {n_evaluations}
- Accept rate (last window): {accept_rate}
- Stagnation level: {stagnation_level} (0=fresh, 1=plateaued)

## Leaders — current niche champions (description + score)
{leaders_block}

## IMPROVING niches — frontier advanced this window (what is actually paying off)
{improving_block}

## SATURATED niches — many recent attempts but frontier stuck (mined out)
{saturated_block}

## Under-explored niches — few recent attempts (room to push)
{under_explored_block}

## Accumulated failure knowledge — every error seen so far, by recurrence
{error_knowledge_block}

## Previous advice (carried over so you can refine, not repeat)
{previous_advice_block}

## Your task
Write the new advice block using EXACTLY these four short sections, in
this order, with these literal headers and no other markdown:

WORKING: <1-2 sentences naming the concrete approach / structure / mechanism
that the IMPROVING niches and leaders share — read their descriptions and
describe the algorithm itself, not any meta-process. If nothing is clearly
working yet, say so plainly.>

SATURATED: <1-2 sentences naming any behavioural niche / strategy family
that keeps attracting attempts but no longer improves — i.e. the SATURATED
niches above. Future prompts should de-emphasise this direction. If no
clear saturation, write "none".>

TRY NEXT: <2-3 short imperative suggestions, ordered by priority. Be
code-shaped (mention specific data structures, algorithms, numerical
ranges, library calls). Build on WORKING, push into the under-explored
niches, and EXPLICITLY move away from SATURATED — do NOT propose more of
the same.>

AVOID: <1-2 anti-patterns drawn from the accumulated failure knowledge
above, prioritising the most recurrent ones. Skip generic defensive advice
(constraint checks that the grader already enforces, type validations,
etc.) unless they recur heavily here.>

Total length: under 140 words. No preamble. No extra headers. No bullet
characters — write each section as a single short paragraph after its
header.

#   • shift      — 2 anchors, design a fundamentally new paradigm.

# The orchestrator picks the mode based on stagnation level (low →

# number of anchors. See ``BladeConfig.paradigm_*_max_stagnation`` and
# ``BladeOrchestrator._pick_paradigm_mode`` for the authoritative routing:
# deepest stagnation routes to ``shift`` (a genuinely new paradigm is the
# most reliable way out of a plateau), the mid band to ``surgical``.

# Paradigm Synthesis Challenge

## Problem
{problem_description}

## Function Signature
```python
{function_signature}
```

## Archive Snapshot
The archive has run {n_evaluations} evaluations and currently occupies
{n_cells} behavioural cells. Stagnation level is {stagnation:.2f}
(0 = just improved, 1 = stuck). The search is **mildly stalled**:
several anchors are close in score but no single mutation has
combined their strengths.

### Top anchors (close-in-score, full code)
{anchor_block}

### Other paradigm inspirations (description + score only)
{inspiration_block}
{strategy_log_block}
## Your Task

Your job is **synthesis**, not invention. Read the anchors and write
ONE new program that combines 2-3 concrete mechanisms drawn from
different anchors into a structurally coherent whole, beating each of
them individually.

First, write a ``## Analysis`` section. Its first line MUST be
``MOVE: SYNTHESIS``. After that line, include exactly these three
sub-sections:

1. **Component table.** A mapping like:
   - Initialisation: from Anchor X (reason …)
   - Optimisation core: from Anchor Y (reason …)
   - Constraint repair: hybrid (reason …)
2. **Coherence note.** A sentence describing how the borrowed
   components share data — variable layout, units, call ordering.
   This is the hard part of synthesis: avoid Frankenstein code.
3. **Why this should beat all anchors.** One sentence per anchor:
   "beats anchor X because …".

Then write the program. Avoid any strategy whose Strategy-Log entry
has delta ≤ 0 — that approach has already failed. Do NOT just retune
constants in one anchor (the mutation worker is already doing that).

### Critical requirements
1. Function signature MUST match exactly: `{function_signature}`
2. Include ALL necessary imports at the top of your code
3. Every helper function must be defined here (don't reference functions
   from the anchors by name unless you copy their definition)

# Paradigm Shift Challenge — Genuinely New Approach

## Problem

## Archive Snapshot
The archive has run {n_evaluations} evaluations and currently occupies
{n_cells} behavioural cells. Stagnation level is {stagnation:.2f} —
the search is **moderately stalled**, suggesting the current paradigm
family has been mined out.

### Strongest paradigms currently in the archive (full code)
{anchor_block}

### Other paradigm inspirations (description + score only)
{inspiration_block}
{strategy_log_block}
## Your Task

Design a **fundamentally different algorithmic approach** — a
paradigm class that does NOT appear in any anchor or inspiration
above. The new program's internal data structures, control flow, and
termination condition must all reflect the new paradigm.

Concrete forbidden moves:
- Re-running the same algorithm with new constants.
- Stitching a sub-routine from one anchor onto another (that is
  synthesis, not a shift).
- Renaming variables in an existing anchor.

First, write a ``## Analysis`` section. Its first line MUST be
``MOVE: SHIFT``. After that line, include exactly these four
sub-sections:

1. **Paradigm name.** The textbook name of the algorithm class you
   are proposing (e.g. "Lloyd relaxation", "Power diagram packing",
   "Lagrangian relaxation with subgradient ascent", "Branch-and-cut
   over a conflict graph").
2. **Why this paradigm fits the problem.** Two sentences. Cite the
   specific problem feature that the paradigm exploits.
3. **Why current anchors miss it.** One sentence: what assumption
   the anchors share that the new paradigm drops.
4. **Risk.** One sentence on the most likely implementation pitfall
   and how your code avoids it.

Then write the complete, runnable program. Avoid any strategy whose
Strategy-Log entry has delta ≤ 0 — that approach has been tried.

### Critical requirements
1. Function signature MUST match exactly: `{function_signature}`
2. Include ALL necessary imports at the top of your code
3. Implement the paradigm yourself — do not assume any non-stdlib
   exotic library is available beyond numpy / scipy.

## Your Task

A new paradigm will NOT help here — previous paradigm trials confirm
that. What WILL help is a **precise structural improvement** to the
champion. Be the careful surgeon, not the wild inventor.

First, write a ``## Analysis`` section. Its first line MUST be:
``MOVE: SURGICAL``.After that line, include exactly these four sub-sections:

1. **Tightest constraint.** Identify the single mechanism most likely
   limiting the champion`s score right now. Cite the exact function,
   loop, variable, update rule, repair step, acceptance rule, objective
   calculation, or magic constant. Prefer a bottleneck where the current
   algorithm wastes useful signal, accepts poor moves, loses feasibility,
   converges too early, or leaves exploitable slack.

2. **Structural fix.** Propose exactly ONE local structural change that
   directly addresses this constraint. The fix must change the algorithm`s
   behaviour in a meaningful way, such as adding score-aware acceptance,
   improving repair, using existing slack/objective information, adding a
   targeted local polish, or replacing a weak update rule. Do not merely
   rename variables, reformat code, change comments, change the random
   seed, or retune an isolated constant.

3. **Preservation list.** List the routines, constants, and control-flow
   blocks that will remain unchanged. The champion's overall algorithm
   class, I/O contract, and working components must stay intact.

4. **Expected delta.** Briefly explain why this specific fix should
   improve the score, and name the main risk. State how the implementation
   guards against that risk, e.g. fallback to the old state, feasibility
   check, bounded step size, deterministic randomness, or NaN/Inf guard.

Then write the complete program. Implement exactly ONE structural, local
fix. Do not add unrelated improvements. Do not introduce a fundamentally
different paradigm. If the champion already computes a score, feasibility,
slack, loss, or quality signal internally, prefer using that signal to
guide the fix rather than adding a blind heuristic.

### Critical requirements
1. Function signature MUST match exactly: `{function_signature}`
2. Include ALL necessary imports at the top of your code
3. Keep the champion's overall control flow and naming intact
