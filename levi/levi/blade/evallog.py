"""``eval_code_log.jsonl`` — the source code of every candidate a run produced.

``snap.json`` records Navigator calls and new bests, and
``checkpoints/checkpoint_NN.json`` dumps the archive at each window close, but
both only ever contain programs that *survived*. A candidate that failed to
parse, raised, scored invalid or hit the evaluator timeout leaves nothing
behind — which is exactly the material you want when the question is "what did
the models actually write, and why did most of it not work".

This writer keeps one record per candidate, whatever became of it:

``code``
    The parsed program, or ``None`` when the model never produced one (in
    which case ``llm_response`` holds what it did produce, if available).
``status``
    ``ok`` (evaluated, no error), ``eval_failed`` (evaluated, error or
    timeout) or ``no_code`` (nothing to evaluate).
``score`` / ``metrics`` / ``error``
    Exactly what the evaluator returned.

Records are appended and flushed one line at a time, so a run killed by
``tmux kill-session`` or a wall-clock cap still has a complete log.
:meth:`finalize` folds the lines into the single ``eval_code_log.json``;
``scripts/eval_log_to_json.py`` does the same for a run that never got there.

Like :mod:`levi.blade.snaplog`, every public method swallows its own
exceptions — instrumentation must never take down a paid run.
