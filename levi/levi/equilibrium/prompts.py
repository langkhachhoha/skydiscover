The three paradigm-shift prompts (``early``, ``mid``, ``late``) are dispatched
by :func:`get_budget_stage` keyed on the live PPS stagnation depth s(t):

  * ``early``  (s low)  — radically different algorithmic paradigm
  * ``mid``    (s med)  — synthesise strengths from existing solutions
  * ``late``   (s high) — surgical refinement of the best solution

All three accept a ``{strategy_log_block}`` placeholder so the strategy

the model writes its solution. The block is empty before any PE has fired.

## Problem
{problem_description}

## Function Signature
```python
{function_signature}

## Current Best Solutions (From Different Behavioral Regions)

The archive has evolved through {n_evaluations} evaluations across {n_regions} behavioral regions.
Below are the best-performing solutions from each region:

{representative_solutions}
{strategy_log_block}
## Your Challenge: PARADIGM SHIFT (early-stage exploration)

We are still EARLY in the search. The archive only knows a handful of paradigms.
Your goal is to engineer a **fundamentally different algorithmic approach** that
explores untapped regions of the solution space.

### Analysis Steps:
1. **Identify current paradigms**: What algorithmic family does each solution above belong to? (greedy, graph search, dynamic programming, simulated annealing, gradient methods, brute-force with pruning, …)
2. **Find the gap**: Which paradigm classes are NOT represented in the archive or strategy log?
3. **Design a novel approach**: Pick ONE gap-paradigm and design a complete solution around it. The internal data structures, control flow, and termination condition must all reflect that paradigm — not a re-skin of an existing solution.

### Instructions:
1. Match the function signature exactly.
2. AVOID the core logic, heuristics, and search structures used in the archive.
3. AVOID any approach whose summary already appears in the Strategy Log (especially ones with non-positive deltas).
4. Pick a strategy that is structurally different, not just numerically retuned.

### Critical Requirements:
- Your function signature MUST match exactly: `{function_signature}`
- Use only standard Python libraries (numpy, collections, itertools, math, heapq, functools, etc.) and torch if needed
- The code must be syntactically valid and complete
- Include ALL necessary imports at the top
- Do NOT use placeholders, ellipses (...), or incomplete code
- Ensure the solution handles all edge cases

## Output
Output ONLY complete, runnable Python code in a ```python block. No explanations before or after.

Below are the best-performing solutions from each region:

{representative_solutions}
{strategy_log_block}
## Your Challenge: SYNTHESISE A STRONGER SOLUTION (mid-stage consolidation)

Search has been running for a while and has accumulated several decent
approaches across distinct behavioural regions. Pure exploration is no longer
the best move — your goal is to **combine the best ideas** from the existing
solutions into a stronger hybrid that beats each individually.

### Analysis Steps:
1. **Per-region strengths**: For each region, identify *one* concrete mechanism it does well (e.g. better initialization, a clever tie-breaking rule, an aggressive prune).
2. **Per-region weaknesses**: For each region, identify *one* concrete failure mode (e.g. blows up at the boundary, ignores a constraint, gets stuck on adversarial inputs).
3. **Synthesis blueprint**: Choose 2-3 mechanisms to KEEP from different parents. Choose 1-2 weaknesses to FIX. State this implicitly via your code — do not write prose.

### Instructions:
1. Match the function signature exactly.
2. Borrow and adapt the strongest mechanisms from multiple solutions; do not just copy one of them.
3. Where the Strategy Log shows a synthesis that already produced no improvement, choose a different mechanism mix.
4. The result must be a structurally coherent program — not three solutions stitched together with `if/elif/else`.

### Critical Requirements:
- Your function signature MUST match exactly: `{function_signature}`
- Use only standard Python libraries (numpy, collections, itertools, math, heapq, functools, etc.) and torch if needed
- The code must be syntactically valid and complete
- Include ALL necessary imports at the top

Below are the best-performing solutions from each region:

{representative_solutions}

## Your Challenge: TARGETED IMPROVEMENT (late-stage exploitation)

The archive is mature and stagnation is high. Radical rewrites at this stage
usually under-perform the best incumbent. Your goal is a **focused, high-impact
improvement** to the highest-scoring solution above.

### Analysis Steps:
1. **Study the best solution carefully**: Understand exactly what it does, and crucially WHERE it loses points (which inputs / which constraints / which edge cases).
2. **Find a single weak spot**: Pick ONE specific failure mode. Resist the urge to address several at once — those usually regress.
3. **Make a surgical fix**: Add a targeted patch (extra branch, post-processing step, tighter constraint check, refined tie-breaking) that fixes that failure WITHOUT touching the parts that already work.

### Instructions:
1. Match the function signature exactly.
2. Start from the logic of the highest-scoring solution; keep the overall control flow and data structures intact.
3. Do NOT rewrite the algorithm from scratch.
4. If the Strategy Log already shows a late-stage attempt with delta ≤ 0 targeting the same weak spot, choose a different weak spot.

### Critical Requirements:
- Your function signature MUST match exactly: `{function_signature}`
- Use only standard Python libraries (numpy, collections, itertools, math, heapq, functools, etc.) and torch if needed
