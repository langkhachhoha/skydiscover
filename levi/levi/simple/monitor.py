"""Stagnation monitor for BLADE Lite.

Two stagnation signals, combined by ``max`` into a single
``stagnation_level()`` consumed by the rank sampler:

* **Global stagnation**: evaluations since the global *best* score
  increased — i.e. since the last ``NEW BEST`` event. NEW BEST is
  rare (a handful of events in a multi-hour run), so this signal
  saturates only when the search has truly halted.

* **Local stagnation**: evaluations since the last *admit* — i.e. since
  the last time any cell's incumbent was replaced. Admits are far more
  frequent than NEW BEST events: every time a worker beats a cell
  incumbent (even one that is not the global best), we count it as a
  small step of local progress. When admits also dry up, the search is
  not just failing to find a new global best, it is failing to improve
  any cell — that is the regime where we want β to drop and the sampler
  to broaden.

The combined level is

    stagnation = max(plateau_steps  / plateau_max,
                     admit_gap      / admit_gap_max)

so β shrinks as soon as *either* signal saturates. Tuning them
independently (``admit_gap_max`` smaller than ``plateau_max`` by ~5×) is
intentional: admits happen ~5× more often than new-best events, so we
want the admit-side timer to fire on a tighter horizon.

``accept_rate`` is still reported for the meta-advisor prompt but does
not switch any control pathway.
