"""Parameter-free rank-based parent sampler for BLADE Lite.

Replaces the UCB selector used in prior versions. The design is taken
directly from LEVI's ``AdaptiveRankSampler`` (Zipfian over score rank,
β driven by stagnation) because it has two properties the prior
threshold-heavy selector lacked:

* **Scale-invariant.** Probability depends only on the *rank* of a
  program inside the archive, not the raw score gaps. A small
  improvement at the top of the archive does not collapse the
  distribution to near-deterministic mode.

* **Single derived knob.** β(stagnation) interpolates between argmax
  (high β when search is healthy) and uniform (low β when stuck).
  There is no separate "boost", "grace", or "diversity penalty" — the
  rank already encodes everything.

Crossover parent selection uses a tiny extra rule: the second parent is
drawn from a *different cell* than the first whenever possible, so the
mutation model sees two paradigms to hybridise. This is the only cell-
aware sampling in the system; it does not introduce any new threshold
because cell membership is already discrete.
