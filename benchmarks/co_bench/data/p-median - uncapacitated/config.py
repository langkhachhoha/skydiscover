DESCRIPTION = '''The uncapacitated p-median problem is a combinatorial optimization problem defined on a given graph  G = (V, E)  with  n  vertices and  m  edges. The objective is to select  p  medians (facility locations) from the set of vertices such that the total assignment cost is minimized. The assignment cost is computed as the sum of the shortest distances from each vertex to its nearest selected median, where distances are given by a precomputed complete cost matrix (obtained via Floyd’s algorithm). Formally, given the cost matrix  D \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} , the optimization problem seeks to find a subset  S \subseteq V  with  |S| = p  that minimizes the function:

\sum_{v \in V} \min_{s \in S} D(v, s)

where  D(v, s)  is the shortest-path distance between vertex  v  and median  s . The solution consists of a list of exactly  p  distinct vertices representing the chosen medians.'''


def solve(**kwargs):
    """
    Solves the uncapacitated p-median problem on a given graph.

    Input kwargs:
        - n: int, number of vertices.
        - m: int, number of edges.
        - p: int, number of medians to choose.
        - dist: list of lists, the complete cost matrix (n x n) computed via Floyd’s algorithm.

    Evaluation metric:
        The total assignment cost, defined as the sum (over all vertices) of the shortest distance
        from that vertex to its closest chosen median.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with a single key:
            - 'medians': a list of exactly p distinct integers (each between 1 and n) representing
              the indices of the chosen medians.

    Note: This is a placeholder. The actual solution logic should populate the 'medians' list.

    # Placeholder implementation; replace with your solution logic.
    return {"medians": []}


def load_data(input_file):
    """
    Loads one or more cases from the input file for the p-median problem, optimized for speed.

    This version uses NumPy to perform the Floyd–Warshall algorithm in a vectorized manner,
    which is significantly faster than the pure-Python triple nested loops for moderate-to-large graphs.

    The input file is expected to have one or more cases. Each case starts with a header line
    containing three numbers: n m p, where:
        - n: number of vertices,
        - m: number of edges,
        - p: number of medians to choose.

    This is followed by at least m non-empty lines, each specifying an edge in the format:
        i j cost
    (If there are more than m edge lines, only the first m valid ones are used.)

    For each case, the function builds the complete cost matrix by:
      - Initializing an n x n NumPy array with infinity (and 0 on the diagonal).
      - Processing m valid edges (using the last occurrence for duplicate edges).
      - Running a vectorized Floyd–Warshall algorithm to compute all-pairs shortest paths.

    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries, one per case. Each dictionary contains:
            - 'n': int, number of vertices.
            - 'm': int, number of edges.
            - 'p': int, number of medians to choose.
            - 'dist': list of lists, the complete cost matrix (n x n), converted from a NumPy array.
