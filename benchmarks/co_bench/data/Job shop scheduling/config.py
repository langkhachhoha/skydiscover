DESCRIPTION = '''The job shop scheduling problem requires assigning non-negative integer start times to a set of operations, structured into multiple jobs, each composed of sequential operations. Each operation is processed on a specific machine for a given processing time. The optimization goal is to minimize the makespan, defined as the maximum completion time across all jobs. Constraints include (i) sequential processing of operations within each job, meaning each operation cannot start before its preceding operation finishes, and (ii) non-overlapping scheduling of operations on the same machine. If these constraints are violated, the solution receives no score.'''

    Solves a single job shop scheduling test case.

    Input:
        - n_jobs (int): Number of jobs.
        - n_machines (int): Number of machines (and operations per job).
        - times (list of list of int): A 2D list of processing times for each operation.
          Dimensions: n_jobs x n_machines.
        - machines (list of list of int): A 2D list specifying the machine assignment for each operation.
          Dimensions: n_jobs x n_machines. Note machine is 1-indexed.

    Output:
        solution (dict): A dictionary containing:
            - start_times (list of list of int): A 2D list of start times for each operation.
              Dimensions: n_jobs x n_machines.

            Each start time must be a non-negative integer, and the schedule must respect the following constraints:
                (i) Sequential processing: For each job, an operation cannot start until its preceding operation has finished.
                (ii) Machine exclusivity: For operations assigned to the same machine, their processing intervals must not overlap.

            The evaluation function will use the start_times to compute the makespan and verify the constraints.
