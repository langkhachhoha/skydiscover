DESCRIPTION = '''Given  n  jobs and  m  machines, the goal of the flow shop scheduling problem is to determine the optimal job sequence that minimizes the makespan, i.e., the total time required to complete all jobs on all machines. Each job follows the same machine order, and the processing times are specified in an  n \times m  matrix. The output is a permutation of job indices representing the processing order. If the constraints are not satisfied (e.g., invalid job sequencing), the solution receives no score. The objective is to optimize the makespan using the classical flow shop recurrence.'''


def solve(**kwargs):
    """
    Solves the flow shop scheduling problem.

    Input kwargs:
      - n (int): Number of jobs.
      - m (int): Number of machines.
      - matrix (list of list of int): Processing times for each job, where each sublist
        contains m integers (processing times for machines 0 through m-1).

    Evaluation Metric:
      The solution is evaluated by its makespan, which is the completion time of the last
      job on the last machine computed by the classical flow shop recurrence.

    Returns:
      dict: A dictionary with a single key 'job_sequence' whose value is a permutation
            (1-indexed) of the job indices. For example, for 4 jobs, a valid return is:
            {'job_sequence': [1, 3, 2, 4]}

    Note: This is a placeholder implementation.
