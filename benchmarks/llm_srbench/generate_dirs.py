"""Generate the per-problem benchmark directories for LSR-Synth.

LSR-Synth is a *set* of independent equation-discovery problems, and both
runners in this repo evolve one program against one scoring function, so each
problem gets its own directory — the same layout CO-Bench uses.

A per-domain layout is not possible: LSR-Synth only exposes the variables that
actually occur in the target equation, so ``phys_osc`` mixes ``(x, t, v)``,
``(x, t)`` and ``(t, v)`` problems and the evolved function's signature differs
between them.

Written for each problem::

    benchmarks/llm_srbench/<domain>/<pid>/initial_program.py    seed skeleton
    benchmarks/llm_srbench/<domain>/<pid>/config.yaml           baseline config
    benchmarks/llm_srbench/<domain>/<pid>/evaluator.py          -> lsr_eval
    benchmarks/llm_srbench/<domain>/<pid>/download_dataset.sh   data provisioning
    levi/examples/llm_srbench/<domain>/<pid>/problem.py         SpecEvo / BLADE

Everything substantive lives in ``benchmarks/llm_srbench/lsr_eval.py``; these
files only name a problem and delegate, so regenerating them after an engine
change is safe.

Usage::

    python benchmarks/llm_srbench/generate_dirs.py --limit 10      # reduced set
    python benchmarks/llm_srbench/generate_dirs.py                 # all problems
    python benchmarks/llm_srbench/generate_dirs.py --domain matsci --limit 5
