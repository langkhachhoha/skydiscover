"""Databases for the relay search types.

The population mechanics are unchanged OpenEvolve — island MAP-Elites with
ring migration — because the paper's contribution is *when* a population moves
between models, not how it evolves inside one.  These subclasses exist only so
the ``--search`` flag can name each method and so ``RelayEvolveDatabase`` can
be told apart in logs and checkpoints.
