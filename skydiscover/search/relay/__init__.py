"""RelayEvolve — adaptive population handoff on top of the OpenEvolve backend.

Implements "Relay, Don't Route: Adaptive Population Handoff for Cost-Efficient
LLM-Driven Evolution" with SkyDiscover's ``openevolve_native`` (MAP-Elites +
islands) as the evolutionary backend instead of ShinkaEvolve, and with the
cheap/strong routing baselines the paper compares against.

Search types registered by :mod:`skydiscover.search.route`:

==================== ==========================================================
``relayevolve``      Cheap multi-trajectory exploration → Relay-Gain-driven
                     handoff → shared strong-model refinement.
``relay_all_cheap``  Every call uses the cheap model.
``relay_all_strong`` Every call uses the strong model.
``relay_fixed_switch`` Cheap for a fixed prefix of the budget, then strong.
``relay_random``     Independent coin flip per generation.
``relay_bandit``     Two-armed UCB over {cheap, strong}, rewarded by the
                     realized best-so-far improvement.
==================== ==========================================================

Every one of them runs the *parallel* discovery loop
(``config.max_parallel_iterations > 1``): generation and evaluation of
different iterations overlap, so a run is bounded by throughput rather than
by the latency of a single LLM call.
