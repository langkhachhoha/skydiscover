"""Per-LLM-call cost tracking, written to a JSONL sidecar.

Activated only when ``SKYDISCOVER_COST_LOG`` is set in the environment.
Each successful LLM call appends one record. A ``totals.json`` sibling file
is rewritten on every call so a runner can read the running total cheaply.

This exists because skydiscover's OpenAI wrapper normally discards the
``usage`` object from completion responses, and on a shared OpenRouter key
polling ``/credits`` cannot isolate this run from concurrent activity.

For OpenRouter requests we set ``extra_body={"usage": {"include": True}}``
so the provider returns ``usage.cost`` (USD) — that field is the ground
truth and is what gets logged. For non-OpenRouter providers we log
tokens but ``cost_usd`` will be ``None`` (no provider-side dollar number
is exposed).

A **spend budget** can be set with ``SKYDISCOVER_MAX_COST_USD``. Once the
running total reaches it, every hook registered via
``register_budget_hook`` fires exactly once — the discovery controllers
use that to request a graceful shutdown, so the run stops at the next
iteration boundary with its results intact. This is a *soft* cap for the
same reason blade's ``--dollars`` is: calls already in flight still
complete, so the final total can overshoot slightly. It relies on
provider-reported ``usage.cost`` and therefore only bites on OpenRouter.
